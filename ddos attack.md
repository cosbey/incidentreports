1. Incident Summary:
On [06-20-2023], our organization experienced a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, resulting in a compromise of our internal network for approximately two hours. The attack caused a disruption in network services, rendering them unresponsive to legitimate internal traffic.

2. Incident Details:
During the attack, our network services became inaccessible due to an overwhelming influx of Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets. As a result, normal internal network traffic was unable to access any network resources. The incident management team promptly responded by blocking incoming ICMP packets, temporarily taking non-critical network services offline, and restoring critical network services.

3. NIST CSF Framework Mapping:
The incident response and mitigation measures align with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) as follows:

   a. Identify (ID):
      - Identified the DDoS attack as a security incident.
      - Recognized the attack vector as excessive ICMP packets.

   b. Protect (PR):
      - Enhanced firewall rules to limit the rate of incoming ICMP packets.
      - Implemented source IP address verification on the firewall to prevent spoofed IP addresses.
      
   c. Detect (DE):
      - Deployed network monitoring software to detect and analyze abnormal traffic patterns.
      - Implemented an Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS) to filter suspicious ICMP traffic.

   d. Respond (RS):
      - Promptly blocked incoming ICMP packets to mitigate the attack.
      - Temporarily took non-critical network services offline to prioritize critical services.
      - Restored critical network services to resume normal operations.

   e. Recover (RC):
      - Successfully restored network functionality within two hours.
      
   f. Lessons Learned (LL):
      - Identified the need for regular firewall configuration reviews and updates.
      - Emphasized the importance of ongoing vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.
      - Recommended the development of a comprehensive incident response plan for DDoS attacks.
      - Highlighted the significance of employee awareness and education on cybersecurity best practices.

4. Recommendations:
Based on this incident and the NIST CSF framework, the following recommendations are provided to further enhance our network security:

   a. Regularly review and update firewall configurations to ensure all necessary rules and controls are in place.
   
   b. Conduct periodic vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to identify and address potential security weaknesses.

   c. Develop a comprehensive incident response plan that includes clear procedures for detecting, mitigating, and recovering from DDoS attacks.

   d. Enhance employee awareness and education on cybersecurity best practices, particularly regarding the identification and reporting of suspicious network activities.

5. Conclusion:
The prompt response and effective mitigation measures implemented by the incident management and network security teams successfully resolved the DDoS attack, restoring normal network operations within two hours. The deployment of additional security controls aligns with the NIST CSF framework and will strengthen our network's resilience against future DDoS attacks.

6. Incident Closure:
This incident is now considered resolved and closed. Ongoing monitoring and regular security assessments will continue to ensure the proactive identification and mitigation of potential network security risks.
